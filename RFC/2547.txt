Abstract

   This document describes a method by which a Service Provider with an
   IP backbone may provide VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) for its
   customers.  MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) is used for
   forwarding packets over the backbone, and BGP (Border Gateway
   Protocol) is used for distributing routes over the backbone.  The
   primary goal of this method is to support the outsourcing of IP
   backbone services for enterprise networks. It does so in a manner
   which is simple for the enterprise, while still scalable and flexible
   for the Service Provider, and while allowing the Service Provider to
   add value. These techniques can also be used to provide a VPN which
   itself provides IP service to customers.
